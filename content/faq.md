introduction: All right, friends. Let’s do this. This section will cover basic, frequently asked questions for e-commerce merchants.
questions:
  - question: How long does shipping take?
    answer: >-
      Now that’s a frequent one all right, ain’t it? Your answer to this should *manage customer expectations*. Just like [a good checkout flow](http://bit.ly/2YCN3iG) should. Tell them the truth:

        - US shipping will take between 3 to 5 business days.
        - International shipping will take between 5 and 10 business days.
        - Mars shipping will be automatically redirected to Elon Musk’s Twitter account.
  - question: How do refunds and returns work?
    answer: >-
      It happens. Even the most beautiful of plants will disappoint *someone*. Again, tell it like it is:

        - All discounted items sales are final.
        - If you’d like another version of your item, please use the return label. Instructions are printed on its back.
        - If your item is damaged or not functioning correctly, email us at info@planty.com, and we’ll refund you + send you a new one ASAP!

  - question: How do you handle sensitive customer information?
    answer: >-
      [GDPR](https://media3.giphy.com/media/1FMaabePDEfgk/giphy.gif?cid=790b76115d1fc3ed7656643632f4131f&rid=giphy.gif), am I right? Make sure you’re as transparent as possible with your data handling process. Or, if you’re using Snipcart, just refer to [our ToS and DPA](http://bit.ly/2YJwlyt).
